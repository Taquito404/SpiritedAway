          Spirited Away is the great treasure of 21st-century animation, and we

          The magic of this film exists well beyond simple beautiful animated
          artwork and a moving, well-crafted story; it is how warmly it opens up

          audience.

          It is another film which, whilst having a strong voice and being
          deeply effective, still appeals to a wide range of people. <br />
